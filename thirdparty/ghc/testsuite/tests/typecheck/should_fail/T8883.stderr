    • Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Functor (PF a)
    • When checking the inferred type
        fold :: forall {a} {b}.
                (Functor (PF a), Regular a) =>
                (PF a b -> b) -> a -> b
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘FlexibleContexts’ extension
