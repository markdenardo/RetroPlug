        ...plus 23 others
        ...plus four instances involving out-of-scope types
        (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
      (The choice depends on the instantiation of ‘a’
       To pick the first instance above, use IncoherentInstances
       when compiling the other instance declarations)
