    • Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘showsPrec’
      prevents the constraint ‘(Show a0)’ from being solved.
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’ should be.
      Potentially matching instances:
        instance Show Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Internal.Show’
        instance Show (Foo LiftedRep) -- Defined at T15883d.hs:14:1
