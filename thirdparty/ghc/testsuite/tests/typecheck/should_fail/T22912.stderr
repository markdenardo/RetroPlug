    • Could not deduce ‘Implies c’
        arising from the head of a quantified constraint
        arising from a use of ‘go’
      from the context: Exactly (Implies c)
        bound by a quantified context at T22912.hs:17:16-17
      Possible fix:
        add (Implies c) to the context of
          the type signature for:
            anythingDict :: forall (c :: Constraint). Dict c
        or If the constraint looks soluble from a superclass of the instance context,
           read 'Undecidable instances and loopy superclasses' in the user manual
    • In the expression: go
      In an equation for ‘anythingDict’:
          anythingDict
            = go
            where
                go :: (Exactly (Implies c) => Implies c) => Dict c
                go = Dict
