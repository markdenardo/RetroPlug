T22141a.hs:8:1: warning: [GHC-68567] [-Wdata-kinds-tc (in -Wdefault)]
    • An occurrence of ‘GHC.Num.Natural.Natural’ in a kind requires DataKinds.
      Future versions of GHC will turn this warning into an error.
    • In the expansion of type synonym ‘Nat’
      In the data type declaration for ‘Vector’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘DataKinds’ extension (implied by ‘UnliftedDatatypes’)
