    • Couldn't match type ‘z0’ with ‘n’
      Expected: EQ_ z0 z0
        Actual: EQ_ m n
      ‘z0’ is untouchable
        inside the constraints: Maybe m ~ Maybe n
        bound by a type expected by the context:
                   (Maybe m ~ Maybe n) => EQ_ z0 z0

      ‘n’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          foo :: forall m n. EQ_ (Maybe m) (Maybe n)
        at Simple14.hs:21:1-42
    • In the second argument of ‘eqE’, namely ‘(eqI :: EQ_ m n)’
      In the expression: x `eqE` (eqI :: EQ_ m n)
      In the first argument of ‘ntI’, namely
        ‘(\ x -> x `eqE` (eqI :: EQ_ m n))’
    • Relevant bindings include
        x :: EQ_ (Maybe m) (Maybe n) (bound at Simple14.hs:22:13)
