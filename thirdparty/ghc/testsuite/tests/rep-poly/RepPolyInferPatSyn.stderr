    • The pattern synonym argument pattern
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        T :: TYPE R
      Cannot unify ‘R’ with the type variable ‘c0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • When checking that the pattern signature: T
        fits the type of its context: T
      In the pattern: a :: T
      In the declaration for pattern synonym ‘P’
